  <h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Movies have the power to transport us to different worlds, evoke emotions, and tell captivating stories. Here are a few of my favorite films that have left a lasting impression on me.</p>

  <h2>Classic Movies</h2>
  <p>Classic movies have a timeless appeal and continue to captivate audiences. One of my all-time favorites is "Gone with the Wind," a sweeping historical drama set during the American Civil War. The film's breathtaking visuals, compelling performances, and epic storytelling make it a true cinematic masterpiece.</p>
  <p>Another classic that I adore is "Casablanca." This iconic romantic drama set in World War II showcases unforgettable performances by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. The film's memorable lines and poignant themes of love and sacrifice have made it an enduring classic.</p>

  <h2>Modern Favorites</h2>
  <p>Alongside classic films, there are several modern favorites that have captured my heart. One such movie is "Inception," a mind-bending science fiction thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. The film's complex narrative, stunning visuals, and thought-provoking exploration of dreams and reality make it a must-watch.</p>
  <p>"The Shawshank Redemption" is another modern masterpiece that ranks high on my list. This powerful drama tells the story of friendship, hope, and redemption within the confines of a prison. The exceptional performances and compelling storytelling have made it a beloved film for many.</p>
